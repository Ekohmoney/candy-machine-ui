# Metaplex Candy Machine Reference UI

**Welcome to the user-friendly gateway for creating your unique NFTs!**

**Here's your stepping stone to minting:**

**1. Setting the Stage:**

- **Gather the essentials:** Summon the required dependencies with `yarn install`.
- **Bring the UI to life:** Awaken the interface with `yarn start`.

**2. Configuration Secrets:**

- **Whisper your Candy Machine's identity:** Create a `.env` file to store its public key (`REACT_APP_CANDY_MACHINE_ID`).

- **Establish your connection:** Provide your QuickNode devnet endpoint (`REACT_APP_SOLANA_RPC_HOST`) for seamless communication.

**3. Fueling Your Minting Dreams:**

- **Replenish your devnet SOL:** Ensure your Phantom wallet is brimming with devnet SOL using `solana airdrop 1 YOUR_PHANTOM_WALLET_ADDRESS`.

**4. The Moment of Creation:**

- **Follow the UI's guiding light:** Let the intuitive interface steer you through the minting process, making every step effortless.

**5. Need a Helping Hand?**

- **Don't hesitate to reach out:** If you encounter any obstacles or have questions, feel free to seek assistance.

**Reminders for a Smooth Journey:**

- **Lost Candy Machine ID?** Seek it within the `cache.json` file, residing under the `program.candyMachine` field.
